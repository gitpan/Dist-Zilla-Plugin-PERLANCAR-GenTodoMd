SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

     [PERLANCAR::GenTodoMd]

DESCRIPTION

    Currently this is specific to my setup (e.g. the location and format of
    the todo.org document, the short dist's name). Eventually I'll make it
    generic and configurable enough.

    If there is no todo.org file, nothing will be generated.
